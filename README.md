# My Collection of Mods for the Voron V0

Since I have so many different little mods for my Voron V0, I decided to put them all in one place.

## Mods

### Zero Armor â€“ Full Body Panel Set for Voron V0.2

A full body panel set based on the ZeroV0Panels mod. (Which is based on ZeroPanels by zruncho3d)

The clips are surprisingly strong and hold the panels in place very well. I really liked the original design but wanted full coverage to give it a beefy look, so here it is.

### Locking Stealth Door Handle

This one i remixed based on the [Stealth Door Handle](https://github.com/adooze/ZeroPanels_for_Stock_V0.2/blob/main/README.md) by [@adooze](https://github.com/adooze)
Really cool design but i wanted a locking handle.
